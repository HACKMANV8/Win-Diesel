okay so last week I tried my friend’s Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and wow the zoom was nuts.
I’m also thinking about grabbing the Sony WH-1000XM5 for travel—my AirPods Pro are fine but I want better noise canceling.
oh and for the desk setup, I might switch to the Aula F75 mechanical keyboard, the RGB looks clean.
I also want to buy reMarkable Starter Bundle – reMarkable 2.
